'''
This file is a module that has steady-state equilibrium functions for
the household consumptions c1 and c2 as well as the marginal utility of
consumption in the two-period-lived overlapping generations model.

    Use steady-state equilibrium young age s=1 budget constraint (26) to
    return individual consumption c1 as a function of b2 and arguments.

    So the args intput will be a tuple that has all the arguments
    necessary in equation (26) as well as whatever arguments are
    necessary in FirmsMC.get_w().
